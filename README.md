attempt to leverage the power of data science and machine learning, i.e., neural networks (NN), trans-former NN, convolutional NN (CNN), QLattice, elastic net and CNN-graphic CNN (GCN)-recurrent NN (RNN) to model the RNA degradation. The model learned can predict the potential degradation rate at each base of an RNA molecule, contributing to revealing its mechanism of spontaneous degradation and designing more stable mRNA vaccines. Our experimental simulation results show that XGBoost outper-forms Qlattice, CNN, transformer NN in predicting the degradation. However, none of these models we explored exhibit the superiority over the benchmark method, CNN-GCN-RNN.
